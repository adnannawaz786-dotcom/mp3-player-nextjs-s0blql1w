I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as binary data through text. MP3 files are binary audio files that require proper audio encoding.

For a working MP3 player project, you would need to:

1. Use actual MP3 files from legitimate sources
2. Create short audio samples using audio editing software
3. Use royalty-free music from sites like:
   - Freesound.org
   - Zapsplat.com
   - Adobe Stock Audio
   - YouTube Audio Library

You could also generate a simple tone using audio software or use text-to-speech services to create placeholder audio files.

The file should be placed at `public/audio/sample-track-3.mp3` and would typically be around 3-5MB for a 3-4 minute song at standard quality (128-192 kbps).
