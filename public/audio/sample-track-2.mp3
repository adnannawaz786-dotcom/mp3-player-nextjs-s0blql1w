I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as it requires binary audio data. MP3 files are compressed audio files that contain encoded audio streams, which cannot be created through text-based responses.

To properly set up this file, you would need to:

1. Obtain a real MP3 audio file (either record one, download royalty-free music, or use AI audio generation tools)
2. Place the MP3 file in the `public/audio/` directory
3. Name it `sample-track-2.mp3`

For development purposes, you could:
- Use a royalty-free MP3 from sites like Freesound.org or Zapsplat
- Generate audio using AI tools like Suno, Udio, or similar
- Record a short audio clip and convert it to MP3
- Use a text-to-speech tool to create a placeholder audio file

The MP3 file should be a standard audio file that can be played by the HTML5 audio element in browsers.
